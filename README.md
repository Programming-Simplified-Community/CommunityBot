# CommunityBot

This contains the various services being built for our community!

## CodeJam
This project contains our code-jam related services. 

## Challenge Assistant*
This project utilizes containerization to run user-provided code to see if it passes acceptance criteria for a challenge. A lot of time and effort will probably go
into flushing this service out.

## Api
This is the entry point into our application. Our services are spooled up here and made available.

## Code Assistant
WIP. This is meant to allow users to compare snippets of code between multiple langauges so they can see the fundamentals applied the same ways. 
Helps hammer home that the syntax is what's different...

## Image Creator
WIP: this will help pull images from different services such as Unsplash so we can decorate our embedded messages on Discord or wherever.

## Dashboard
WIP: A web-facing interface for interacting with the data/services.
